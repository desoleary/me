So I am now almost 41 years of age, and I  am quite embarrassed to say I have worked with a black person only **once** in my life as a professional my if my memory serves me right.

It has just dawned on me right now that **white privilege is a thing** and I only understand now what is meant by "gaslighting". 

I would recommend to anyone to check out the panel discussion [here](https://news.sky.com/story/racism-wont-change-until-black-people-no-longer-seen-as-police-property-former-met-diversity-chief-12008645) and tell me if this changes or re-enforces **your perspective** at all? 

As I was in the middle of writing this, I decided to make one small change by ringing the doorbell of the family that lives down the road to my house and start a conversation.

Anyone that knows me, knows I do not have a racist bone in my body, but obviously, I could do a lot more to educate myself and my family, which starts today.

My white privilege is the fact that I know quite well; I can practically walk into another **high-level senior role** without ever having to think about race. This has only become apparent to me now, but I hope it sticks, and I can be a positive advocate for change. 

Before today, I thought of "white privilege" as being an insult to white people like myself who go about their lives never having to think about race because we are somehow part of the solution.

The one thing I did say correctly about the current revolution going on is I wouldn't speak up until I educate myself. I am proud that Canadian education does speak about the negative aspects of our history, and maybe someday, I will gain a little more empathy with what Aboriginals go through every day.

I hope I did a decent job in raising this and please feel free to educate me if I have misstepped, but you have to realize this has only dawned on my now so please forgive me and let us learn together to be a more accepting community.
